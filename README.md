Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Agile-Scrum

# 1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories provide a perspective of what any particular individual expects from a program. While you log these "user stories" you are able to maintain the perspective while simultaniously providing a comprehensive technical break down of the main feature. After these requirements are broken down, they can be interpretted as tasks to complete or functions to implement within a program.
    
# 2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development broken-up into small functionalities. Incremental development and sprint, I think, will work great for most larger projects or personal endevours. When you look at a program as a whole it can seem overwhelming and chaotic. Before any knowledge of agile, large programming projects were one individual large sum of work to accomplish. Using an agile approach it becomes a series of small tasks to complete which can become organized by priority. It eliviates the sense of dred of over-working on one large program, by instead seeing a short intense window of time to implement certain functionality.

# 3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member means you communicate well, and complete tasks in an organized way. When working on updates of existing code, always return it better than you recieved it (the boy scout rule). When developing code, make sure the code is organized and easy for someone else to take over if needed. Readable code with proper naming conventions, layout, variable declarations, functions, and comments will work well in tandem with clear and concise communication with other team members.
